### Setup

First we will want to install `autoenv` and `python3`.

```
    pip install autoenv
    brew install python3
```

Create your virtualenv using python3:
```
    # Keep in mind you can name this whatever you would like but the .env file looks for venv
    python3 -m venv venv
```

* Sometimes autoenv doesnt work, so running `source .env` will initialize everything. *
